# BeeScale

Beehive scale project!

In this project I am using Arduino pro mini (8Mhz, 3.3V) and SIM module SIM800L in combination with RTC DS3231, 
BM280 sensor for barometric pressure and air temperature measurement, 
DHT11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity inside of the beehive,
and as adittion, soil moisture sensor, with some modifications.
