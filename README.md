# BeeScale

Beehive scale project!

In this project I am using Arduino pro mini (8Mhz, 3.3V) and SIM module SIM800L in combination with 
RTC DS3231 for time measurement and waking up from the sleep of the system, 
BM280 sensor for barometric pressure and air temperature measurement, 
DHT11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity inside of the beehive,
and as adittion, soil moisture sensor, with some modifications.

Main goals of the projects are:

Small power consumptions - whole system should work on Lion batteries.
Robust - system should be operated with people with no technical knowledge
Simple to use - As fewer as possible human interaction 

Secondary goals are:

All data should be visible on the some internet portal(IoT)
System should be modular
